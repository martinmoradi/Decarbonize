  'Every tonne of paper recycled saves 17 trees.',

  'Since 1870, global sea levels have risen by about 20 cm.',

  'Ecology translates from Greek to English as the “study of the house".',

  '27,000 trees get cut down every day to make toilet paper alone.',

  'Humanity uses an estimated 80 trillion aluminum cans every year.',

  'Plastic waste kills an estimated 1 million aquatic animals in the sea every year.',

  'Glass takes at least 4000 years to break down in full.',

  'On average between 150 to 200 species go extinct in a single day.',

  'Ernst Haeckel first called the field ecology in 1866.',

  'Old or destroyers computers pose an environmental hazard because of toxic materials in their components.',

  'Paper can be recycled only six times. After that, the fibers are too weak to hold together.',

  'Recycling aluminium drink cans saves up to 95% of the energy needed to make aluminium from its raw materials.',

  'Recycling 1 kg of aluminium saves 8kg of bauxite, 4kg of chemical products and 14 Kilowatts of electricity.',

  'Producing steel from recycled material saves 75% of the energy needed if steel were made from virgin material.',

  'The energy saved from recycling 1 glass bottle is enough a power a light bulb for four hours.',

  'We throw away more than 7 million tonnes of food and drink every year from our homes - most of which could have been safely consumed.',

  "Global warming is the increase of Earth's average surface temperature due to greenhouse gases that collect in the atmosphere like a thickening blanket, trapping the sun's heat and causing the planet to warm up.",

  'Greenhouse gases keep heat close to the earth’s surface making it livable for humans and animals. However, global warming is happening largely due to an over-emittance of these gases and fossil fuels (natural oil, gasoline, coal).',

  "With the start of industry in the 1700's, humans began emitting more fossil fuels from coal, oil, and gas to run our cars, trucks, and factories. By driving a “smarter” car, you will not only save on gas, but help prevent global warming.",

  'There is more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere today than at any point in the last 800,000 years.',

  'Global climate change has already had observable effects on the environment. Glaciers have shrunk, ice on rivers and lakes is breaking up earlier, plant and animal ranges have shifted and trees are flowering sooner.',

  'Heat waves caused by global warming present greater risk of heat-related illness and death, most frequently among people who have diabetes who are elderly or are very young.',

  'Global warming puts coral reefs in danger as the ocean warms, scientist fear that coral reefs will not be able to adapt quickly enough to the resulting changing conditions, and bleaching incidents and diseases will increase.',

  '416 parts per million. The concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) in our atmosphere, as of May 2020, is the highest it has been in human history.',

  '2019 was the second warmest year on record. NASA data show that average global temperatures in 2019 were 0.98 degrees C warmer than the 20th century average. In fact, the five warmest years in the 1880–2019 record have all occurred since 2015.',

  'Eleven percent of all global greenhouse gas emissions caused by humans are due to deforestation 5 — comparable to the emissions from all of the passenger vehicles on the planet.',

  'Tropical forests are incredibly effective at storing carbon, providing at least a third of the mitigation action needed 7 to prevent the worst climate change scenarios. Yet nature-based solutions receive only 3% of all climate funding.',

  "Natural climate solutions such as restoring degraded forests could create as many as 39 jobs per million dollars spent — that's a job-creation rate more than six times higher than the oil and gas industry.",
